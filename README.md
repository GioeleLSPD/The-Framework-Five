**Project Name:** Moody Tunes 

**What does Moody Tunes do?** 

The call to action is selecting their current mood from the available ones into the search bar. We have five possible moods which are: Chill, workout, passion, party and random. Our software will then generate a music playlist accordingly by selecting them from a 30,000 database of songs. Each playlist has its own ranges of values over 7 features, danceability, energy, loudness, speechless, instrumentalness, valence and tempo.

Our goal was to allow everyone to find the correct song based on their mood. 

Feature 2: By analysing our dataset we were able to outline its characteristics. We selected: song number for each genre, number of songs of each artist, total number of songs present in the dataset. 

Feature 3: Artits present in the dataset organised in alphabetical order. 


**We ask the user to:** 

Feature 1: make the system generate the perfcte playlist baed on the mood of the user 

Feature 2: know all the characteristics of the generated playlist 

Feature 3: click on the initial letter of an artist in order to know all the artists whose names begin with the same letter and discover the songs of each artist

**Dataset**

We selected one database, named spotify\_songs, from kaggle. As we needed a large pool of songs in order for our project to work we selected the database 30,000 Spotify Songs. The chosen CSV file is from Spotify API.
